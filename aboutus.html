    <h2>About Jai Shri Ram Foundation</h2>
    <h3 class="overview-heading">Overview</h3>
    <p class="overview-text">
      As a philanthropist for nearly half his life, Pawan Mishra has always believed in the power of selfless service. 
      Guided by the teachings of Lord Shri Ram, his life’s mission has been to uplift those in need, especially 
      the underserved and forgotten sections of society.
      In 2018, this mission took shape with the establishment of the Jai Shri Ram Foundation Thailand a non-profit 
      organization dedicated to serving underprivileged children, elderly citizens, and spiritually inclined communities. 
      The Foundation operates from the heart of Bangkok, extending help through food drives, medical support, educational 
      aid, and spiritual guidance. What began as one man’s vision is now a growing community of devotees, volunteers, and 
      changemakers committed to compassion, culture, and community development. Our programs go beyond basic aid—they 
      inspire hope, instill values, and create a ripple of positivity throughout society. Jai Shri Ram Foundation also 
      actively celebrates Indian festivals, conducts Ramayan recitations, and supports temple initiatives—building bridges 
      between tradition and modern life.

    <h3 class="dream-heading">We believe every act of kindness, no matter how small, is a step toward a better world.</h3>
    <p>
      Inspired by the timeless values of Lord Ram, we are dedicated to building a better society
      through seva, education, and community upliftment. We host events, support underprivileged
      children, and spread dharmic knowledge.
